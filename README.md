In this project I created a multi-document RAG agent using Llamaindex. Before creating the final agent there are a few intermidiate steps that show hoe to create a router, Function_calling and how to create a Reasoning_loop. 
You will see that the Reasonig_loop and Multi_document appear two times: One using the Mistral API and one using the GeminiAPI. That is because Llamaindex provides certain functionalities (at this point in time) for OpenAI, Anthropic and Mistral.
But I wanted to show that the same could be done using Gemini and other functionalities.
